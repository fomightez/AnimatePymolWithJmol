# AnimatePymolWithJmol
Easily animate PyMOL session scenes with Jmol to create an animated GIFs.

Click on any `launch binder` badge on this page to begin. 

The interface that comes up after a temporary session is launched for you will guide you through the process.

No software installaion needed. You'll work entirely in your browser.

Allows making animations from  many PyMOL session files without the need for repeated manual steps.

There is a file to demonstrate the process included as well.

Attribution
-----------

This is a packaging of a process worked out by [Bob Hanson and Eric Martz to use Jmol to make gif animations using PyMOL session files](https://sourceforge.net/p/jmol/mailman/message/36768476/).  
This just packages the process they have worked out up in a convenient interface where users don't need to install any software on their own computer.


Technical notes
---------------

This isn't using the cutting-edge version of Jmol at this time and so it only works with older PyMOL session files. That will soon be addressed.

The best approximation of the PyMOL scene will be produced. It may not be perfect.
